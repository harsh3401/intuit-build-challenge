# Producer-Consumer Pattern Implementation

1. Create the buffer class and its operations ( Shared queue )
2. Create a producer and consumer class with src and destination containers tied here ( can be abstracted out as well )
3. Create the core logic for the same for handling init data and join everything in the main thread


## Instructions 

• Testing Objectives:
• Thread synchronization
• Concurrent programming
• Blocking queues
• Wait/Notify mechanism

• Write comprehensive unit tests
• Document code with comments
